# num_detector is a design.v file meant to practice utilizing out creative freedom with multiple valid approaches to design the component.
# num_detect_tb is the corresponding tb.v file meant to practice for loop logic for testing the design.v modules.

# The constraints were mapped where the input number bits were switches, and the output mapped to corresponding LED's.
